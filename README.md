# Svasthya Fresh — Frontend (React + Vite)

This repository contains a React frontend scaffold for the Svasthya Fresh design you provided. It uses Vite for fast dev tooling.

Setup

1. Place the images you provided into `public/assets` (create this folder):
   - `logo.png` (header logo)
   - `logo-small.png` (footer smaller logo)
   - `hero.jpg` (signup hero image)
   - `market-illustration.png` (footer illustration)
    - `logo.png` or `logo.svg` (header logo)
    - `logo-small.png` or `logo-small.svg` (footer smaller logo)
    - `hero.jpg` or `hero.png` (signup hero image)
    - `footer.png` (footer illustration) — components reference `/assets/footer.png`

2. Install dependencies and run dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes

Notes about images
- I added SVG placeholders earlier. To use your real artwork, place the PNG/JPG files with the names above into `public/assets` and the dev server will pick them up.

If you want, I can:
- Add routing and more pages (Home, Products, Contact)
- Integrate Tailwind or a component library
- Import the images directly from the attachments you uploaded into the repo
